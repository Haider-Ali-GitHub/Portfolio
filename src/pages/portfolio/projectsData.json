    "description": "For Android Photos, I was tasked with porting our JavaFX-based 'Photos' project to an Android app, using Android Studio and Java. This project was focused on implementing core functionalities like album management, photo display, and tagging, specifically for the Android platform. Key features included creating, deleting, and renaming photo albums, adding and removing photos, and implementing a search function for photos based on tags. The app was optimized for the Nexus 4 device emulator, adhering to Android API 34 specifications. My role was critical in adapting the JavaFX project to the Android environment, ensuring a smooth user experience and seamless functionality on Android devices.",

    "description": "For the Game of Life project, my responsibility was to develop and optimize Conway's classic cellular automaton in Java, focusing on creating an interactive and user-friendly interface. This involved implementing the fundamental rules of the game, such as cell survival, reproduction, and death based on neighboring cells. Key functionalities included the ability to start, pause, and reset the simulation, dynamically adjust the grid size, and manually alter the state of individual cells to create various patterns. The project emphasized efficient algorithm implementation to handle large grid sizes and high-generation simulations smoothly. My role was pivotal in ensuring the game adhered to the original rules set by John Conway while offering a modern, interactive user experience in Java",
